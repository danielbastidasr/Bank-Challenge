# iOS Clean Architectured App

[![CI](https://github.com/danielbastidasr/Bank-Challenge/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/danielbastidasr/Bank-Challenge/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

A client would like a directory app to allow staff to:
 - See all of their colleagues contact details
 - See which rooms in the office are currently occupied.
 - Filter feature written in swiftUI

# ðŸ”Œ Data Source

The API that provides the necessary data is located at https://5dd56c23ce4c300014402e6b.mockapi.io/fake/ and is RESTful with 2 resources:

- users 
- rooms

Both support `GET` requests to list the data and also to directly access individual records (the API is read only).

# ðŸ“– TODO

- Refactor code
- Connect SwiftUI feature package to project
